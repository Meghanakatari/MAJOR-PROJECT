9. Training and Building the model

Flask Framework
----------------
10. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
11. Importing the packages
12. User gives input as Feature Values 
13. The given input is preprocessed for prediction
14. Trained model is used for prediction
15. Final outcome is displayed through frontend
Extension
----------
In the base paper the author mentioned to use different Dataset for analysis with Deep learning models like CNN, RNN, RBM and DNN with MLP, in which CNN got 96% of accuracy,
As an extension we applied an ensemble method  combining the predictions of multiple individual models to produce a more robust and accurate final prediction.
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other ensemble techniques such as CNN + LSTM got 99% of accuracy for KDD-Cup dataset,
As an extension we can build the front end using the flask framework for user testing and with user authentication.
